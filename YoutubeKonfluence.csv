And they intend to push a vaccine that will affect 50% of the population from current vaccine results.   With the inability of the medical system to intervene on the behalf of the millions made deathly ill from the vaccine it will leave up to 166 million Americans very ill or dead.

I think it's very important to understand that math. The problem is  that, like you saw, most math material is either too vague or too detailed for someone who's starting ML. So I think it's best to do the steps you mentioned (start coding right away, using ML models right away, etc) and give yourself more time to learn the math. Take it slowly. \n\n\nWith a good learning plan and good study habits, you can learn in less than a year the math (linear algebra, calculus, and statistics) needed for ML. Once you do that, you'll feel so much more confident in your work.\n\n\nFor example, I'm sure you don't regret learning about SVMs. You just wish the material was better organized and better explained. üòâ\n\nAnyway, great video.

In real life, it\'s rare that you have enough data for the model to actually get better results than those other two methods. There are a few free papers online comparing ML to classical methods for time series data if anyone reading this is interested. Definitely consider other options!

I think the reason that many people follow the machine learning hype and get disappointed comes from not understanding that machine learning is just a tool - its a means to and end and not an end in itself. There are many cool advancements in machine learning like reinforcement learning where you make the model learn to play video games or in the future make the model drive a car on its own (Tesla still doesn't fully utilize reinforcement learning) but ML is very math heavy (for software engineers) but not so much for math majors."", '8:41 ""Linear Regression, that\'s too basic"" \nBeginner programmer with barely any math background: ""What...?!?!""', ""Same sentiments from a fellow SWE here; you're not the only one.

Yes, most of the calculations in Linear Algebra are simple if you know the tricks and the concepts.  But, what makes Linear Algebra a difficult math class is the proofs and they require abstract or critical thinking.  If I had to rate the difficulty of this math class, I would say it is near the difficulty level of Calculus 3 and Elementary Differential Equations.  Plus, if someone were to pass Calculus 2 and is having trouble picking what math class to take next, I would recommend either taking Linear Algebra or Calculus 3 first, depending on your schedule, professor and school.  Better yet, I would recommend taking these math classes concurrently because they go well together.

I've tried to explain the process.\n\nLet's track it from the beginning:\nHere the hypothesis equation (or linear regression equation) is:\nhŒò(x) = w*x +b  \nThis means that we have to multiply the input (denoted by 'x') by the weight (denoted by 'w') and then add the bias term (denoted by 'b') to the product.\nDuring matrix multiplication, we take the first row of the data_matrix (x) and multiply it with the first column of the parameter_vector (w).\nhŒò(x) = (0.25)*x + (-40)\nTo obtain the result as 0.25 * element of data_matrix + (-40) we need to keep a term as 1.\nWe can write it as @9:30 or like this:\ndata_vector  \n[2104     1]   *   [0.25\n                            -40]\nThe multiplication would be done in the following way: (2014*0.25) + (1 * -40)           {first row element of data matrix * first column element of parameter_vecotr + second element of data_matrix * second element of parameter_vector}\nIf you analyze the multiplication result, it is the same as:  x*0.25 - 40        {hŒò(x) = w*x +b, where w is 0.25 and b is -40 i.e. hŒò(x) = x*0.25 - 40}\n\nAt @9:30, the same thing is written in a slightly different way:\n[1      2104]   *    [-40 \n                             0.25]\nThe result is: 1*(-40) + 2104 * 0.25, which is same as 2104*0.25 - 40  {hŒò(x) = x*0.25 - 40}\nSo we are adding a 1 before or after the data (depending on how we write the parameter_vector) in data_matrix in order to correctly form the equation: hŒò(x) = x*0.25 - 40.\n\nPlease feel free to ask if any of this does not make sense."", 'can anyone help me with 7:28 on why we made a matrix [1 2104] and multiplied with the parameters?', ""Isn't this doing a ton of unnecessary multiplication by 1?
