Trump NEVER told the American People to use ‚Äúdisinfectants‚Äù as a medicinal for personal self-administration.  The direction of his gaze shown in this out of context clip was toward his medical team advisors sitting at the side of the room.  In fact, several medicinals are delivered via inhalation through nebulizers, inhalers, and even during intubation.  In the spirit of leaving no treatment option unconsidered in that earlier time of exploration, he was merely asking his team a question.  Many anti-Trump media outlets slyly /cleverly /nefariously took this shortened clip and sequenced it immediately with a memo from the manufacturer of Clorox, admonishing the medicinal use of their product for self-medication.  This is psychological manipulation and trickery - the pairing of two constructs to make them appear related during a ‚Äúnews‚Äù story.  You are counting on people NOT thinking critically about the version of truth you want to portray, believing everything coming from your authoritative and truthful reputation for accurate ‚Äúnews‚Äù.  The American People are not so stupid any longer.  Stop this false narrative that Trump wanted us to ingest poison.  We know what caustic liquids are, and we read warning labels on products.

It means they required some serious medical intervention just to save their lives after they took this poisoned vaccine that is being pushed through at lightening speed. That means that if this same vaccine was given to the entire U.S. population then there would be over 66 million Americans made deathly ill that would not be able to receive medical intervention because the hospitals would not have the capability to treat them. \n",

And they intend to push a vaccine that will affect 50% of the population from current vaccine results.   With the inability of the medical system to intervene on the behalf of the millions made deathly ill from the vaccine it will leave up to 166 million Americans very ill or dead.

However, this anti-inflammatory pathway is not working, due to lack of vitamin D.  https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.18.210161v1 , for a summary: http://aminotheory.com/cv19/icu/#2020-McGregor .   \n",

The problem is  that, like you saw, most math material is either too vague or too detailed for someone who's starting ML. So I think it's best to do the steps you mentioned (start coding right away, using ML models right away, etc) and give yourself more time to learn the math. Take it slowly. \n",

You need to dig a little deeper and perform some initial analysis (can be totally manual) regarding the data you have and then play around with the models. Once you have a clear understanding of your data-set it'll be easier to decide what ML model and feature extraction mechanisms would work best. \n",

      "I think one of the hardest things I had to learn about ML was that ML won't always give you the best solution... especially with very classical kinds of data like time series. With time series, I always had better success with Exponential Smoothing or Season Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average models than with something like a Long Short-Term Memory/Recurrent Neural Network model even if I spent a ton of time tuning hyperparameters, dropout rates inside the cells, etc. Couldn't get it anywhere close to the classic methods in terms of lowering the average error rate of guessing the next step. In real life, it's rare that you have enough data for the model to actually get better results than those other two methods. There are a few free papers online comparing ML to classical methods for time series data if anyone reading this is interested. Definitely consider other options! Just because the phrases \"Machine Learning\" and \"Neural Network\" get the higher-ups excited when they hear it doesn't mean it's the only choice you have!\n",

In order to fully understand machine learning you need to be comfortable with the relevant math. The kind of people who go into machine learning are the people who are usually into math and not into software engineering much. I think the reason that many people follow the machine learning hype and get disappointed comes from not understanding that machine learning is just a tool - its a means to and end and not an end in itself. There are many cool advancements in machine learning like reinforcement learning where you make the model learn to play video games or in the future make the model drive a car on its own (Tesla still doesn't fully utilize reinforcement learning) but ML is very math heavy (for software engineers) but not so much for math majors.\n",

What if those facts are important and to be taken into consideration but just cuz someone may get offended youre therefore removing it? so define offensive properly. Some are facts and some are trolling and actually troll content meant to malign you sure may filter and remove *them* . but please don't tell me that numbers are racist or are offensive.

      "As someone who has taken Linear Algebra in the past, I must admit Linear Algebra is a fun and worthwhile (especially if you are majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics) but challenging math class.  Yes, most of the calculations in Linear Algebra are simple if you know the tricks and the concepts.  But, what makes Linear Algebra a difficult math class is the proofs and they require abstract or critical thinking.  If I had to rate the difficulty of this math class, I would say it is near the difficulty level of Calculus 3 and Elementary Differential Equations.  Plus, if someone were to pass Calculus 2 and is having trouble picking what math class to take next, I would recommend either taking Linear Algebra or Calculus 3 first, depending on your schedule, professor and school.  Better yet, I would recommend taking these math classes concurrently because they go well together.  Bottom line, Linear Algebra is one of the best Math Classes that STEM majors will enjoy in college assuming if they pay attention and work hard at it.\n",

After being in quarantine so long, I find that I would like to reduce my screen time while still making some time to watch content I enjoy. Many seem to enjoy the 20 minute videos, but I wonder if you might consider splitting up the content or maybe even including time stamps so I can skip ahead to my preferred content? I know you work very hard and you do produce beautiful vlogs, I just hope you might take this comment under advisement :).\n",

Each goal category can be one of the following statuses \"set, not set, working, complete\". I want a pivot table showing the summary of all 4 goal categories per class and the status of the goal. When I put these into the row, column and values fields I end up with multiple statuses in each goal category. Is there a way to fix this?\n",
